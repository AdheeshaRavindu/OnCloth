2. **Multiple Angles**: Show front, back, and detail shots
3. **Model Shots**: Include at least one image with a person wearing the hoodie
4. **Details**: Capture fabric texture, stitching, and special features
5. **Color Accuracy**: Ensure images accurately represent actual product colors

## Fallback Images

The website includes fallback SVG placeholders if images fail to load. However, for production, all images should be properly uploaded.

## Optimization

Before uploading, optimize images:
- Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Adobe Photoshop "Save for Web"
- Compress without significant quality loss
- Convert to JPG for photographs, PNG for graphics with transparency
