            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            
            <p>By placing an order or using our Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our Website.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            
            <p>You must be at least 18 years old to make a purchase on our Website. By placing an order, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Products and Pricing</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Product Information:</strong> We strive to display accurate product descriptions, images, and prices. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions, images, or other content is accurate, complete, or error-free.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> All prices are listed in United States Dollars (USD). We reserve the right to change prices at any time without notice. The price charged will be the price displayed at the time of order placement.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Availability:</strong> All products are subject to availability. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Orders and Payment</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Order Acceptance:</strong> Your order is an offer to purchase products from us. We reserve the right to accept or decline your order for any reason, including product availability, errors in pricing, or suspected fraudulent activity.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> We accept cryptocurrency payments only through Coinbase Commerce. All payments must be completed before order fulfillment.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payment processing is handled securely by Coinbase Commerce. We do not store your cryptocurrency wallet information on our servers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Order Confirmation:</strong> Once payment is confirmed, you will receive an order confirmation email. This email confirms that we have received your order, not that your order has been accepted or shipped.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Shipping and Delivery</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Shipping:</strong> We ship worldwide. Shipping costs and delivery times vary by location. Please refer to our <a href="shipping.html">Shipping Information</a> page for details.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Delivery:</strong> Delivery times are estimates and not guaranteed. We are not responsible for delays caused by customs, weather, or courier issues.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Risk of Loss:</strong> All items purchased from our Website are made pursuant to a shipment contract. Risk of loss and title for items pass to you upon delivery to the carrier.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Returns and Refunds</h2>
            
            <p>Please refer to our <a href="returns.html">Returns & Exchanges</a> page for detailed information about our return policy, including conditions, timeframes, and procedures.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Refund Processing:</strong> Cryptocurrency refunds will be issued in USD equivalent to your original payment address within 5-7 business days after we receive and inspect the returned item.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Original shipping costs are non-refundable unless the return is due to our error (defective, damaged, or incorrect item).</p>
